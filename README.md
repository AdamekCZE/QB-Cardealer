# QB-Cardealer
Cardealership script for qbus that requires managers to buy and hold stock to be able to sell vehicles.
Comes with boss menu where you can hire unemployed players, promote, fire and demote employees.

Installation requires creating a society (name + money) and cardealer_stock (stock + price + vehicle) tables.

Vehicles are taken from the config files, they need to be present in the shared.lua if you wish to sell them to players and they need to be present in the cardealer_stock table.

Script does not include invoicing
Please don't ask me to include a SQL script, they're not super complicated tables.

# Installation
Add this resource to your server, create the society and cardealer_stock tables and insert vehicles in the database and config
