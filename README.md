# QB-Cardealer
My first script I ever made, it's terribly inefficient and should not be used for a server but only to learn something from it.

Installation requires creating a society (name + money) and cardealer_stock (stock + price + vehicle) tables.

Vehicles are taken from the config files, they need to be present in the shared.lua if you wish to sell them to players and they need to be present in the cardealer_stock table.

Script does not include invoicing
Please don't ask me to include a SQL script, they're not super complicated tables.

# Installation
Add this resource to your server, create the society and cardealer_stock tables and insert vehicles in the database and config
